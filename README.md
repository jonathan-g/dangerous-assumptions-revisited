# Dangerous Assumptions

Calcuations of assumed decarbonization in RCP scenarios, versus observations.
This analysis was inspired by Roger Pielke, Jr., Tom Wigley, and Christopher
Green, "Dangerous Assumptions," _Nature_ **452**, 531 (2008) 
<https://www-nature-com/articles/452531a> 
and 
Samantha Stevenson and Roger Pielke, Jr., "Assumptions of Spontaneous 
Decarbonization in the IPCC AR5 Baseline Scenarios," 
<https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0aef/69f0117b6f4e1d2926e1acaa6db7af963924.pdf>
as well as a recent talk Pielke presented in Japan.

I was curious what the comparison of the observed rates of change of energy and 
carbon intensity to rates implied by RCP scenarios would look like if we used
the last decade or so of the world trends, instead of focusing on the anomalous
period of rapid growth of carbon intensity and energy intensity corresponding to
the rapid industrialization of China from around 2000--2007.
